Jar entries in this location are discovered by the system LutFinder. This allows
ImageJ applications that cannot access a file system to have a means of
providing a set of lookup tables to ImageJ.

Lookup tables discovered by the LutFinder are subsequently installed in the
Lookup Tables submenu.

The lookup tables in this Jar can be overridden by end users by placing a .lut
file of the same name in the application's luts directory on the file system.
