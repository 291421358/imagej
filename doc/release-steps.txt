Releasing a new version of ImageJ2 involves three broad steps:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. BUILD IMGLIB2 RELEASE BINARIES:

1) In ImgLib repository, create a temporary release branch:
       git co -b release

2) Create a commit that updates the version numbers for the release.
   This should be modeled after the previous release; e.g.:
       git show v2.0.0-beta3

   Typically this consists of the following steps
   (where "2.x.x" is the desired release version):
       # update project version to 2.x.x
       mvn versions:set
       # add needed properties block to toplevel POM
       vi pom.xml
       # replace any remaining SNAPSHOT versions (esp. in broken subtree)
       git grep SNAPSHOT | xargs sed -i '' -e 's/SNAPSHOT/2.x.x/'
       # commit the result, with message modeled after previous releases
       git ci -a

3) Tag the release:
       git tag v2.x.x

4) Make sure everything builds successfully:
       mvn clean install

5) If all is well (i.e., "BUILD SUCCESSFUL") then deploy the result:
       mvn -DskipTests deploy

6) Push the tag:
       git ps origin v2.x.x

7) Delete the no-longer-needed release branch:
       git branch -D release

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. BUILD IMAGEJ2 RELEASE BINARIES:

1) In ImageJ2 repository, create a temporary release branch:
       git co -b release

2) Create a commit that updates the version numbers for the release.
   This should be modeled after the previous release; e.g.:
       git show v2.0.0-beta3

   Typically this consists of the following steps
   (where "2.x.x" is the desired release version):
       # update project version to 2.x.x
       mvn versions:set
       # add needed properties block to toplevel POM
       vi pom.xml
       # verify that no SNAPSHOT versions remain
       git grep SNAPSHOT
       # commit the result, with message modeled after previous releases
       git ci -a

3) Tag the release:
       git tag v2.x.x

4) Push the tag:
       git ps origin v2.x.x

5) Delete the no-longer-needed release branch:
       git branch -D release

6) Tell Jenkins to build and deploy the launcher for the just-pushed tag:
       http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ-launcher/build?delay=0sec

7) Tell Jenkins to build and deploy ImageJ2 itself for the just-pushed tag:
       http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ/build?delay=0sec

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. UPDATE ONLINE RESOURCES:

1) Download the new application ZIP from the Jenkins build:
       http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/ImageJ/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/app/target/imagej-2.0.0-beta3-application.zip

   Rename the ZIP to delete the "-application" suffix.

2) Upload the new JARs to the ImageJ2 update site.

3) Upload the ZIP to GitHub's Downloads section:
       https://github.com/imagej/imagej/downloads

4) Create a blog post on developer.imagej.net:
       http://developer.imagej.net/node/add/blog

   It should be modeled after previous blog entries; e.g.:
       http://developer.imagej.net/2012/07/13/imagej-v200-beta3

   Make sure to add the ZIP file as an attachment to the post.

5) Update the Downloads page at:
       http://developer.imagej.net/downloads

6) Send a release announcement to the mailing lists (ImageJ and imagej-devel).

   It should be an abbreviated version of the blog post, modeled after
   previous release announcements; e.g.:
       http://imagej.net/pipermail/imagej-devel/2012-May/000975.html
